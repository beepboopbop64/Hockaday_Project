Response: I gave a 100 to designing a solution because I helped my mother, who is an internal medicine physician, treat uninsured patients and helped give them a solution to their health issues. I gave a 100 to empathy because I got to meet many patients struggling financially who also had many health problems. They did not have insurance nor did they have the money for proper care at professional hospitals. Seeing people struggle to receive the care they deserve and have a right to helped build my empathy and my desire for helping people get the care they need. I gave exploring a purpose 100 as well because through seeing these patients and helping my mom treat them, I explored a potential career as a doctor. Hence I explored a purpose‚Äîthat purpose being to help patients and less fortunate people receive medical aid. Because this gave me real world experience, actually being present and seeing the world‚Äôs health issues and financial situations, I got a glimpse of how the real world works. I gave advocacy skills a 90 because though I was actively participating in helping and advocating for people‚Äôs needs, I think of advocacy skills as more spreading awareness and being vocal about problems, and that‚Äôs not completely what I was doing.
